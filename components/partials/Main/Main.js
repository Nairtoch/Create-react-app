        Phil rescued Ranboo from a lava pit, which Ranboo was very grateful for. 
        They continued to have a pleasant conversation with it, ending on good terms. Phil seems to consider Ranboo a friend.
        While Phil was initially angry at Ranboo for joining the Butcher Army and contributing to him being put under house arrest, 
        he saw that Ranboo didn't really want to be there and forgave him after Ranboo came by to apologize later. 
        He half-heartedly attempted to prevent Techno from killing Ranboo, although gave up upon seeing how bloodthirsty Techno was.

        Phil did attempt to ditch Ranboo while heading back to L'Manberg, although he didn't attack him as Techno did. 
        He seemed appreciative of Ranboo's gift of two netherite ingots and was seemingly alright with Ranboo knowing that he 
        was taking shelter at Techno's base. During the Doomsday war, Ranboo said that Tubbo had a totem of undying, defending Philza.

        After the Doomsday War, he let Ranboo stay with him and Techno at their base. Phil has been seen to be very protective of Ranboo, 
        Especially when others want to do things to Ranboo. He got into an argument with Fundy for trying to experiment on Ranboo 
        due to his silk touch abilities and defended him, yelling the Ranboo was still a person even if he was part enderman. 
        Phil is very considerate of Ranboo's safety, even making a pathway for Ranboo at the bridge so he wouldn't fall into the pond.

        Technoblade is Phil's best friend. Phil often helps Techno cause chaos and has shown pride in Techno for sticking to his beliefs. 
        Phil and Techno get along, with Phil helping him move and building farms for Techno to use. 
        According to Phil, They met when Techno was young.
        Phil has proved his loyalty to Techno several times over, with him adamantly refusing to give up the location of Technoblade 
        to the Butcher Army. He expressed visible fear when Techno's Compass was discovered and attempted to cover it with a lie, 
        claiming that it led to a potato farm. He defended Techno's nature, saying that he had changed and that his past 
        war crimes of deploying withers L'Manberg were "water under the bridge." He has referred to himself as "Techno's hidden sword," 
        implying that he would come to his defense if need be.

        The two are aligned in their anarchistic ideals and they both shared their dislike for L'Manberg's government, 
        with Phil claiming he saw formerly kind people become corrupted by politics. 
        Phil is one of the only three people to who Techno revealed his second vault, with the others being Tommy and Dream. 
        He supported Techno's ideas of blowing up L'Manberg with multiple withers.
